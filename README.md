A statistical approach to colorectal cancer diagnosis based on protein signature.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer of the last several inches of the colon,the lower part of the large intestine. Colorectal cancer often starts as clumps of cells called polyps. It is the third most common type of cancer in the United States[1]. Cancer cases have decreased with the use of Colonoscopies.The current procedure includes a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) for pre-selection of cases for further colonoscopic evaluation. However, its accuracy is quite low and does not adequately detect subjeocts with CRC. A non-invasive method for pre-selection of screening for CRC is in need. We have anazyled data collected by Surinova, S. et al.[2] which contains information about protein concentration in CRC and Healthy patients and built a statistical model to predict the possibility of presence of CRC in a subject. This is clearly a classification problem and using Logistic Regression, we were able to identify 6 proteins which correlate more with prevalence of CRC.
